### Introduction:
As an ethical hacker, I am always on the lookout for potential security vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of my devices and networks. Recently, I conducted a penetration test on my own D-Link DSL router and discovered a security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the router and compromise the security of my network. In this blog post, I'll share the details of the vulnerability and how I fixed it.


### Focus:
In conducting this penetration test, I learned several important lessons that are worth sharing:
   
  -  It's important to conduct ethical hacking: Penetration testing should only be conducted with prior permission from the owner of the network or system being tested. Unauthorized access to someone's router or network is illegal and could lead to legal consequences.
  -  Always update your devices: Keeping your devices and software up-to-date is critical to ensure that any known security vulnerabilities have been addressed.
  - Change default login credentials: The default login credentials for many devices are widely known and can be easily exploited by attackers. It's important to change the default login credentials to something more secure.
  -  Be aware of the risks of storing sensitive information: The configuration file for my router contained sensitive information, including login credentials. It's important to be aware of the risks of storing sensitive information and to take appropriate measures to protect it.

### Conclusion:
Discovering and fixing a security vulnerability in my own D-Link DSL router was a valuable learning experience for me as an ethical hacker. It's important for all of us to be vigilant about potential security vulnerabilities in our devices and networks, and to take responsible steps to fix them. By staying informed about the latest security best practices and keeping our devices and networks up-to-date, we can help prevent security breaches and protect our information.
