Hello Hackers,<br>
Recently I started my bug-hunting journey and got an XSS.<br>
Now I am back with another XSS by Double Encoding. <br>
This attack technique consists of encoding user request parameters twice in hexadecimal
format to bypass security controls or cause unexpected behavior from the application. <br>
Itâ€™s possible because the webserver accepts and processes client requests in many encoded forms. <br>
This Write-up shows how important it is to test every single input field on any Website even if it is just. So let us start. 
While hunting on a Website (Vulnerability not fixed yet) let's say vulnerable.com I searched for input places. <br>
The Website is designed for booking hotels, rooms, etc. So I started searching for a wonderful expensive hotel to book.<br> 
we are finally awake the world ive always wanted I'm executed with this world <br>
