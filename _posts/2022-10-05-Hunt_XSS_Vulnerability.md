Hello Hackers,<br>
I started my bug-hunting journey and got an XSS.<br>
While hunting on a Website (Vulnerability not fixed yet) let's say example.com I searched for input places. The Website is designed for booking hotels, rooms, etc. So I started searching for a wonderful expensive hotel to book.<br>
Reflected XSS bugs are great fun to find; they are everywhere and the impact can be big if the injected payload is carefully crafted.
<br>
 
When starting any pentest try any input user because some developer trust user, and that's the fault.

<br> <br>
First, try `"><lol>` (Check input)  then try the payload compatible.<br>
Here trust user input, don't encode it .<br>
Ok, lets try this simple payload `"><BODY ONLOAD=alert("KHAFAGY_WAS_HERE")>`
<br> <br>

<br> <br>
Now I see some error referring to accepting the payload

 Ooh, No encode and nothing stops me

     Never trust user input ever.
